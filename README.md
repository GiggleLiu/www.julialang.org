This is the GitHub repository for the Julia programming language project's main website, [julialang.org](http://julialang.org/). The repository for the source code of the language itself can be found at [github.com/JuliaLang/julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).

The Julia website is generated using GitHub pages and Jekyll, as [explained here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages).

## Running using Docker

After installing [`docker`](http://docker.com/), run `make run` to build and run the website within the a container built from the [`jekyll/jekyll` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll/) that contains all the necessary prerequisites.  Modifying files will cause the website to rebuild in real time.

## Installing locally

In short, be sure you have ruby installed, and then run these commands

    gem install bundler
    
Next, you will need to change your present working directory to the root of this repository. 

To install bundler, run

    bundle config set path 'vendor'
    
then

    bundle install 

from the root of this repository to fetch all dependencies and install them locally.
You only have to do this once.

Now you need to check your ruby version by running `ruby -v` in the terminal. 

If you are on `ruby 2.6.3p62` or older run: 

    ./bin/jekyll serve --future

Else run:

    bundle exec jekyll serve --future

in the root of this repository to serve it, usually on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
Or with other options, such as internet-visible on port 4444 with all drafts:
    
    ./bin/jekyll serve --incremental -H 0.0.0.0 -P 4444 -l --future --unpublished --drafts 
    
The above code is for `ruby 2.6.3p62` or older. The below code is for any version that is newer. 

    bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental -H 0.0.0.0 -P 4444 -l --future --unpublished --drafts

You can then edit the sources and Jekyll will rebuild changed files. To see
changes, reload the page you edited.
